# IoT -- EE 629

## Final Project: Home Security Camera

###  The motivation for this project is to provide a security system powered by Python and Raspberry Pi.

### To complete this project, I have used Raspberry Pi 4, 5 Megapixels 1080p Sensor Mini Camera Module, PIR Sensor Infrared (IR) Body Motion Module, and 3 female-to-female jumper wires.

Use Python, a PIR sensor, Raspberry Pi, and PiCamera to detect motion, record h264 video with timestamp, convert to mp4, then email video as an attachment from Gmail.
