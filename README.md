# IoT -- EE 629

## Final Project: Home Security Camera

###  The motivation for this project is to provide a security system powered by Python and Raspberry Pi. I researched various WiFi-enabled home security cameras, but I found them costly to install. Since I had a basic knowledge of Python and a Raspberry Pi already on hand, I decided to do this project. I learned so much in the process and had so much fun along the way.

### In this project, I will use Raspberry Pi 4, 5 Megapixels 1080p Sensor Mini Camera Module, PIR Sensor Infrared IR Body Motion Module, and 3 Female to Female Jumper Wires.
